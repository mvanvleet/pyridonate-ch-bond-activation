# Gaussian Files and Structures for Pyridonate Pincer Complexes

This repository contains Supplementary Information pertaining to the manuscript "A σ-Poor, π-Rich Pyridonate Pincer Ligand Designed to Enhance C-H Oxidative Addition at Platinum Group Metals: Experimental and Computational Studies" as submitted to _Organometallics_. 

The repository contains:
* Gaussian input (.com) and output (.log) files for all geometry optimizations, single-point energy calculations, NBO calculations, and relaxed scans
* .xyz files corresponding to all optimized structures at the wB97X-D/def2-TZVPP level of theory
* A summary Excel spreadsheet containing energies and free energies for various calculated species, along with the associated energy and free energy barriers for the various transitions states (TS) described in the manuscript

The naming scheme for files is outlined in the Excel spreadsheet and is listed below for convenience.

| File         | Compound # | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
