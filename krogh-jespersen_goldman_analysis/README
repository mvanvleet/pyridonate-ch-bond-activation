Note: Input files for select systems (1-F, 2-F) given in this section that do
not appear in the main text. These systems were run for benchmarking purposes
to reproduce the literature results.

Also note: The original Goldman paper used an older version of Gaussian and
NBO5 (rather than NBO7). However, we're able to reproduce their sigma and pi
values to within ~0.005 of the original numbers, so it is unlikely that
version differences significantly affect the conclusions.
